E-Commerce Product Listing Page
This project is a basic implementation of an e-commerce product listing page with a focus on simplicity, visual appeal, and user interactivity. Below, you will find details on how to set up and understand the structure of the project.

Project Structure
index.html: Main HTML document containing the structure of the product listing page.
styles.css: CSS file for styling the HTML elements and making the page visually appealing.
script.js: Optional JavaScript file for implementing interactivity features such as hover effects and sorting functionality.
Project Features
1. HTML Markup
The HTML document (index.html) is structured to include a header, navigation bar, and a product section. Each product entry consists of an image, name, price, and a "Buy Now" button.

2. CSS Styling
The styles.css file contains styles to make the page visually appealing and ensure it is responsive on both desktop and mobile devices.

3. Dummy Product Data
Dummy product data is included in the JavaScript file (script.js) to simulate a real product listing. You can customize this data or add more entries as needed.

4. Interactivity
Hover effects are implemented on the product cards for a visually interactive experience. Additionally, clicking the "Buy Now" button triggers a basic confirmation message, which can be an alert or a modal.

5. JavaScript (Optional)
The optional JavaScript file (script.js) includes functionality to sort products based on price in ascending and descending order. This feature enhances the user experience by providing a dynamic way to organize product listings.
