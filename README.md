# E-Commerce Product Listing Page

This project is a basic implementation of an e-commerce product listing page with a focus on simplicity, visual appeal, and user interactivity. Below, you will find details on how to set up and understand the structure of the project.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML document containing the structure of the product listing page.
- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling the HTML elements and making the page visually appealing.
- `script.js`: Optional JavaScript file for implementing interactivity features such as hover effects and sorting functionality.

## Project Features

### 1. HTML Markup

The HTML document (`index.html`) is structured to include a header, navigation bar, and a product section. Each product entry consists of an image, name, price, and a "Buy Now" button.

### 2. CSS Styling

The `styles.css` file contains styles to make the page visually appealing and ensure it is responsive on both desktop and mobile devices.

### 3. Dummy Product Data

Dummy product data is included in the JavaScript file (`script.js`) to simulate a real product listing. You can customize this data or add more entries as needed.

### 4. Interactivity

Hover effects are implemented on the product cards for a visually interactive experience. Additionally, clicking the "Buy Now" button triggers a basic confirmation message, which can be an alert or a modal.

### 5. JavaScript (Optional)

The optional JavaScript file (`script.js`) includes functionality to sort products based on price in ascending and descending order. This feature enhances the user experience by providing a dynamic way to organize product listings.

## Getting Started
